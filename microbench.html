      <h1>Microbenchmarking</h1>
<!--       <p>My CUDA programming started at the time when Kepler generation was introduced. NVIDIA has a funny habit to
      completely rework GPU hardware form one generation to another. I really love it. It makes CUDA programming
      interesting even more. So, I started to learn CUDA programming. I started with reading official NVIDIA documentation.
      I noticed that CUDA programming guide quite well describe ideology of streaming programming, high-level concepts
      and common principals of CUDA programming. As a matter of fact, it is intended to be useful for people who just started
      to learn CUDA. As for me, I noticed that documentation just mark approaches as good and bad without any explanation.
      For example, a term non coalesced load. Every time when this term appear in documentation it says that non coalesced
      transactions is a root if evil. Yep, it is not free because such load need more than one cache line. But the
      question is in cost itself. Assume latency of L1 cache is 50 cycles. Memory access pattern require 4 cache lines
      per warp request. Will it cost 50*4 or 50+3 cycles or something else. Programmer could decide how much effort to
      make depending on that cost. Another interesting questing is a balance between arithmetic and memory latencies.
      I mean, How many operation should be done per byte </p>
      <p>At some point I decided to code a small set of microbenchmark programs for </p> -->

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <img width="100px" src="images/21_16.png" alt="l1_16kb"> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.

This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
