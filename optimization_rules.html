      <h1>Essential Optimization Rules</h1>
      <p>What does it mean to be pragmatic optimizer? Here is a simple, but essential set of rules that maimed to help
      you to do your optimization work optimally. </p>
      <h2>1. Say NO to premature optimization</h2>
      <h2>2. Time and profile, then optimize</h2>
      <p>Be aware of current function runtime. Newer start optimization before timings are done.</p>
      <h2>3. Optimize the most consuming function first</h2>
      <p>Be objective. Do not choose the easiest, the funniest, the first called and so on. Keep in mind that 80% of time
      is spend in 20% of code.</p>
      <h2>4. Identify performance limiters</h2>
      <p>What limits performance of optimizing function? Is it a number of memory transactions? Is it a critical path is
      arithmetic? Is it Lack of computational resources of particular type? Depending on kind of limiters your optimization
      strategy will vary. If you do not do this you will spend ages overcoming problem that is not present.</p>
      <h2>5. Compute only what is necessary</h2>
      <p>Empty function body is extremely fast, but does nothing useful. First off all understand the optimizing function
      and define the set of required operations. Get rid of everything except this set.</p>
      <h2>6. Load only what is necessary</h2>
      <h2>7. Understand the reason of speedup</h2>
      <h2>8. Keep it simple</h2>
      <p>Optimization is always a tread of between code simplicity and ultimate runtime. You always should consider this
      submitting new optimizations.</p>
      <h2>9. Check one approach in time</h2>
      <p>Do not try to apply all you ideas in once.</p>

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <img width="100px" src="images/21_16.png" alt="l1_16kb"> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.

<blockquote>
This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
